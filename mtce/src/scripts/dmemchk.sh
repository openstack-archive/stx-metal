# Description: Displays memory usage information to check for memory leaks.
#
# Behaviour   : The script takes in a list of commands whose processes you want
#               monitored and then finds their process IDs, and uses that to find
#               their current Resident Set Size (RSS) using ps, and looks up their
#               Proportional Set Size (PSS) in /proc/<pid>/smaps. Only the initial
#               process run by the system is monitored; child processes and other
#               instances of these processes are ignored.
#
# This script is to be run on a controller node, and requires that it be run
# with sudo privileges or else it may not have access to /proc/<pid>/smaps for
# each of the desired processes.
#
# The script should be run with the following options:
# sudo ./memchk -t [#] --C [commands]
# Where following -t the time in seconds with which you want this script to repeat
# should be indicated. The default if no time is specified is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
# Following --C all arguments are viewed as commands you wish to be monitored.
# Each command should be separated by a space.
# e.g. sudo ./memchk -t 1800 --C command1 command2 command3
#
# Error logs can be found in /tmp/memchk_err.log
# Standard output can be found in /tmp/memchk_out.log

            # and such 'eratic' behaviour is not indicative of any overall trends.
            # NOTE: If you would like to do this properly and determine whether or not such patterns exist by evaluating the RSS usage accross the entire
            #       lifespan of the script, consider the following method:
            #       Take the (RSS, time) value-pairs and make an augmented matrix and then use Gaussian elimination to solve the matrix and use the remaining
            #       values as the coefficients to create a least-squares parabola, which you can then find the first derivative of to determine the rate of
            #       change -- which will indicate increasing or decreasing behaviour at your current point relative to nearby datapoints and the behaviour
            #       of the rest of your graph (function).
            #       To do this consider using the python package numpy for matrix math and for derivatives. The issue with this method is finding a way to
            #       pipe data to a python script and have it return to the bash script. Because piping is usually done asynchronously, you may find that there
            #       are issues with having the values returned and printed properly in the bash script. This math can also be done in bash, but will take
            #       considerable effort.
            #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            # This part checks to see that an established trend is being maintained.
            # It first checks that trend[pid] is greater than or equal to 3 because the else-block below increments the trend number such that when the same
            # pattern e.g. an increase in RSS that exceeds the baseline average occurs 3 times in a row, it establishes that there exists a trend of RSS increasing.
            # The existence of a pattern or 'trend' is gauged by whether the same behaviour has occured 3 times in a row, and that it continues to occur without
            # the opposite behaviour happening. For example, if a trend of increasing RSS has been observed, and on the next sample the RSS value is found to
            # be below the baseline average, this indicates that a decrease has occured and thus the trend has been broken, and a new trend must be established.
            # If the current trend is either increasing or decreasing, the RSS value can be equal to the baseline average for two consecutive samples without
            # the trend being broken. However, if the RSS value is equal to the baseline average for 3 consecutive samples, this indicates a new trend of the
            # RSS value reaching a stable value, and the current trend of increasing or decreasing is broken; that is to say, only a trend of 'stable' will be
            # permitted; if an increase or decrease is observed, all temporary and trend values will be reset, and the code will enter the else-block below and
            # attempt to establish a new trend from scratch. The reason for this behaviour is that trends are determined by observing a behaviour three
            # consecutive times, if a stable behaviour starts turning into an increasing or decreasing behaviour, the else-block is entered to wait for a new
            # behaviour to be established.
            # A trend cannot change immediately from increasing to decreasing. This is done to avoid representing erratic behaviour as a long-term pattern.
            # An increasing or decreasing trend must change to 'none' -- no trend observed -- before the opposite trend can be declared.
